What is this?
=============

FUSE-NT is really two pieces of software:
  1) A Windows IFS driver component (ifs/), and
  2) A set of patches to the FUSE userspace libraries (fuse-2.8.5/)

Together, these pieces seek to enable FUSE filesystems written against the
latest version of the libfuse API to run unmodified on Cygwin on Windows
systems.


Who are we?
===========

We (the FUSE-NT Authors) are Robert Bart, Elliott Brossard, Conrad Meyer, and
Tim Vega. We are (at the time of this writing) undergrads in Computer Science
and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington.


Errata
======

Lots of things are broken; in particular, none of the userspace stuff is
remotely thread-safe yet; nothing exits cleanly or cleans up after itself;
and the userspace code tends to segfault in various places. When it breaks,
you get to keep all of the pieces! :-)
